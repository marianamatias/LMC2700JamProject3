# Assignment Description

_This project was started and completed over the course of 1 hour and 15 minutes._

In this project, students used a method called Context-Free Grammar (CFG) to generate non-interactive text. A CFG is a way to describe, read, or create structured, formal languages.

This is a computational writing project in which students wrote a grammar that generates interesting iterations on a pattern of writing of some kind, like advertisements, slogans, greetings, letters etc. When I started brainstorming, I tried to think of templates that we use that I could replace some words with randomized ones from my database.

## Running the Generator
To run the generator, download the xml files, open a command shell, navigate to the directory you downloaded, and run this command:

>python cfg.py -g grammar.xml

where grammar.xml is the filename you want to run.
