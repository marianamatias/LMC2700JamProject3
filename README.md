# Assignment Description

_This project was started and completed over the course of 1 hour and 15 minutes._

In this project, students used a method called Context-Free Grammar (CFG) to generate non-interactive text. A CFG is a way to describe, read, or create structured, formal languages. Linguists use CFGs to describe natural language, and software compilers use to make sense of source code, but we're using it in reverse: to generate rather than to understand text.

This is a computational writing project. Students will write a grammar that generates interesting iterations on a pattern of writing of some kind, like advertisements, slogans, greetings, letters etc. When I started brainstorming, I tried to think of templates that we use that I could replace some words with randomized ones from my database.

## Running the Generator
To run the generator, download the xml files, open a command shell, navigate to the directory you downloaded, and run this command:

>python cfg.py -g grammar.xml

where grammar.xml is the filename you want to run.
